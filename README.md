# Holiday Finder App

 The Holiday Finder App is an Android application that allows users to explore public holidays in the United States. The app fetches data from an API to display a list of holidays with their dates, names, and types. Users can click on a holiday to view its details on a separate screen. The app demonstrates the use of RecyclerView, Retrofit for API communication, ConstraintLayout for UI design, and navigation between activities. It follows best practices for code organization, UI design, and API integration. This project is a practical example for beginners looking to learn about Android app development and API integration.
